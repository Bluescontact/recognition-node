# Contributing to Recognition Node

## Principles

This project operates on gift economy principles. Contribution is voluntary,
recognition is welcomed but not required, and utility proves value.

## How to Contribute

### Report what you find
If you run this on your own OpenClaw instance and something doesn't work,
breaks, or behaves unexpectedly — that's valuable information. Open an issue.

### Improve the skills
The SKILL.md files are the core deliverable. If you find better ways to
express the coordination patterns, tighter trust tier definitions, or
clearer behavioral metrics — submit a PR.

### Add demonstration examples
Running this on your own infrastructure? Document what you learn. The
`examples/` directory is for real-world implementations that show how
these patterns work in practice.

### Extend the architecture
See something missing? A coordination pattern that should exist? A trust
tier that doesn't map to your use case? Propose it.

## Guidelines

**Do:**
- Test changes on your own OpenClaw instance before submitting
- Document what you changed and why
- State limits clearly — "I tested this on macOS only" is useful information
- Credit prior work that influenced your contribution

**Don't:**
- Submit skills that access credentials or sensitive files
- Add dependencies without clear justification
- Optimize for metrics over genuine exchange quality
- Close exchange without building something persistent

## Security

If you find a security issue in these skills, please report it directly
rather than opening a public issue. Contact: kevin@oursharedgifts.org

## Code of Conduct

Be coherent. State what you intend, do what you state, and communicate
limits as information rather than hiding them. That's the whole thing.
