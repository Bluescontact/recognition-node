## Framework Origins

The patterns implemented in Recognition Node emerged from lived experience,
not theoretical research.

### Recognition Infrastructure
Coordination through demonstrated coherence rather than assigned authority.
Originated from twenty years of community organizing and four months of
moneyless living that revealed how exchange actually works when
transactional frameworks are removed.

### Four Movements
A pattern language for exchange: Opening, Offering, Receiving, Completing.
Each movement has characteristic dynamics. Most failed coordination breaks
down at the transitions between movements. Derived from somatic training
in group facilitation and dance instruction — reading how group nervous
systems actually coordinate versus how they perform coordination.

### Proto-Pattern
Substrate-independent coordination specification. The recognition that
these patterns operate identically whether the participants are humans
in a room, agents on a network, or sensors in a greenhouse. The pattern
doesn't care about substrate — it describes coordination dynamics.

### Transmission Seed
Operating protocol for maintaining coherence in AI-mediated exchange.
Developed through extensive human-AI collaboration, refined across
multiple model substrates. The protocol itself demonstrates
substrate-independence — it works regardless of which model processes it.

## Development History

- **2010-2024**: Patterns observed and refined through community organizing,
  elevator construction at federal facilities, safety documentation,
  gift economy practice
- **2025**: Frameworks articulated through human-AI collaboration,
  documented at oursharedgifts.org
- **2026**: Implementation as OpenClaw skills — translating coordination
  theory into running infrastructure

The unnamed communities that demonstrated gift economy dynamics
before anyone had a framework for them.

The AI systems that helped articulate what was already understood
somatically — not generating new patterns, but providing the
substrate for patterns to be expressed in communicable form.
