# Skill Audit Example

Demonstration of Recognition Node provenance skill auditing installed
OpenClaw skills for behavioral coherence.

## Status: Planned

This example will document:
- Running a provenance audit on all installed skills
- Interpreting divergence scores
- Identifying skills that access more than they claim
- Building a local trust registry for vetted skills

## Use Case

With 341+ malicious skills already found on ClawHub (as of Feb 2026),
and the ecosystem growing faster than human review can keep up,
automated provenance verification is not optional — it is infrastructure.

This example shows how to use the provenance skill to audit your own
installation and contribute behavioral profiles back to the community.
