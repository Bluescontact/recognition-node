# Aquaponics Monitor Example

Demonstration of Recognition Node infrastructure skill monitoring
an aquaponics system on off-grid solar power.

## Status: Planned

This example will document:
- Sensor wiring diagrams for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen
- MQTT topic structure for aquaponics data
- Alert threshold configuration for New Mexico climate
- Seasonal adjustment patterns
- Integration with graduated-trust for autonomous pump management

## Hardware List (planned)
- Atlas Scientific pH sensor kit (EZO circuit + probe)
- 3x DS18B20 waterproof temperature probes
- DHT22 ambient sensor
- ESP32 as sensor hub (WiFi to MQTT to Pi)
- Relay module for pump control (Tier 3 only)

## Notes
This is a living document. Updated as the physical build progresses.
